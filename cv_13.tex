\section{Scientific Outreach, Interests and Miscellaneous}

\vspace{5pt}

\small{\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Computing Skills:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Python: primary language, with NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pandas etc. Mostly algorithmic and numerical work, with data visualisation 
\item C++: secondary language. Mostly with regards to computational mathematics/physics
\item \LaTeX
\item Working knowledge of Mathematica for computational mathematics and data visualisation.
\item Comfortable working in common operating systems: Linux (primary), Microsoft Windows, Mac OS.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Spoken Language:} English (native proficiency).
\item \textbf{Citizenship:} Australian and Irish (dual citizenship).
\item \textbf{Cosmos Science Magazine (Editorial Intern):} In 2006, at age 16, I completed an editorial internship at Cosmos, an Australian popular science magazine. After some time there I began writing articles instead, three of which were published. These were:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{``Coming up trumps; chemistry's most useful invention started with a game of cards''}
\item \textit{``A bundle of energy''}
\item \textit{``A fish called Jaws''}
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Contemporary Physics (Textbook Reviewer):} In this role I have reviewed several textbooks for the journal Contemporary Physics. These titles are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{``Quantum Information Theory and the Foundations of Quantum Mechanics''}, C.G.  Timpson (2004).
\item \textit{``Conductor-Insulator Quantum Phase Transitions''}, by V. Dobrosavljevic, N. Trivedi and J.M. Valles (2012).
\item \textit{``Quantum Hall Effects''} [in progress], Z.F. Ezawa (2013).
\end{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Undergraduate Student Representative}: During my time at the University of Wollongong, I was elected to the position of undergraduate student representative on the School of Physics Board. In this role I liaised with students and staff, bringing the concerns of my peers to the attention of their lecturers and vice versa. In particular, I petitioned the board to allocate funds for the introduction to the curriculum of a general relativity course, which was taught for the first time in 2012.}
\item{\textbf{University of Wollongong Physics Society (Co--Founder):} I was a co--founder of the University of Wollongong Physics Society, which became instantly popular among the small but nevertheless passionate and talented student body in the School of Physics. Among our regular activities were invited technical talks by lecturers and postgraduates from the department, regular lunchtime screenings of documentaries, end of term festivities, a popular liquid nitrogen ice--cream stall on campus and a \textit{very} successful trivia team.}
\item{\textbf{Physics Society Lunchtime Tutorials (Organiser):} During my time at the University of Wollongong, the undergraduate curriculum was heavily lecture-based, with no seminars, problems classes or tutorials. Through the physics society, I helped to organise and teach informal bi-weekly tutorials. Students who were struggling with work could come and ask us whichever questions they needed help with, and receive assistance for free.}
\item{\textbf{Kaggle Data Science Bowl 2016 (Team Member):} I am currently competing in a data science and coding competition. Together with the computer scientists, mathematicians and bioinformaticians on my team, I am helping to write code which, drawing on ideas from artificial intelligence, will diagnose lung cancer by `looking at' scans.}
\item{I am a classical and Spanish guitarist, and play in a small ensemble with friends; we are a guitar, violin, viola, bass and mandolin. I also enjoy hiking and rock climbing.}
